# neuro-air-lite

Hierarchical multi-agent air quality analyst for Hong Kong, built from the
Neuro-Air paper (npj Clean Air 2026) and the `acodercat/Neuro-Air` reference
implementation. One Coordinator plans, five workers share a single persistent
Python runtime, and a Verifier recomputes the key numbers from the database
before the answer is released.

This is the 10-day implementation walkthrough; the plan lives next to this
folder as `Neuro-Air 10-Day Implementation Plan (A to Z).pdf`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 (pinned in `.python-version`, installed by `uv`)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Docker Desktop (PostGIS 16 + 3.4)
- An OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint. Development target is local Ollama
  (`qwen2.5-coder:14b`); a stronger API model is swapped in for the Day 9
  evaluation via `LLM_MODEL_STRONG`.

## Setup

```powershell
uv sync
Copy-Item .env.example .env    # already present in a fresh checkout of this machine
```

Start the database:

```powershell
.\scripts\dev_up.ps1           # starts Docker Desktop if needed, waits for healthy
docker compose ps
```

Docker Desktop does not reliably start with Windows, so `dev_up.ps1` checks the
engine first instead of failing with `pipe not found`. Enable "Start Docker
Desktop when you sign in" in its settings to make the script a no-op.

Check everything wired up:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/check_env.py
```

The DB and LLM lines are `[skip]` until Docker and Ollama are running; that is
expected on a fresh machine and `--strict` will fail on them once you want a
hard gate. To prove the model can actually produce a runnable code block:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/llm_smoke.py
```

Ollama only serves 4096 tokens of context by default, which truncates the
schema prompt on Day 4. Raise it once per machine and restart `ollama serve`:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH','16384','User')
```

## Layout

```

## Database

The schema lives in `domains/hk/schema.sql` and is applied by:

```powershell
uv run python scripts/init_db.py               # create tables + neuro_ro role
uv run python scripts/init_db.py --roles-only  # skip tables, refresh password + grants
uv run python scripts/init_db.py --reset       # DROP schema public CASCADE first
uv run python scripts/check_db.py              # Day 1 acceptance checks
```

`--reset` destroys every ingested row, so after Day 2 use `--roles-only` when you
only need the role and grants reapplied.

`init_db.py` also creates the `neuro_ro` role from the credentials in
`DB_URL_RO`, grants it `SELECT` on everything, forces
`default_transaction_read_only=on` and sets a 5 s `statement_timeout`. Ingestion
and `truth_sql` use `DB_URL_ADMIN`; the agent never sees that URL. `domains/hk/db.py`
is the only sanctioned way to build either engine (`make_ro_engine()` and
`make_admin_engine()`); the read-only profile pins `pool_size=5`,
`max_overflow=10`, `pool_pre_ping=True`, `connect_timeout=5` and passes
`statement_timeout` as a startup option so a changed role default cannot lift it.

The Postgres superuser password comes from `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env`
(`docker compose` reads that file automatically). It only applies when the
`pgdata` volume is first created; changing it later needs `ALTER USER` or
`docker compose down -v`.

14 tables, all following the reference implementation: `air_quality_station`,
`hourly_station_air_quality`, `street`, `road_segment`,
`hourly_road_segment_traffic`, `weather_station`, `hourly_station_weather`,
`osm_feature`, `eia_project`, `eia_habitat`, `traffic_camera`,
`sensitive_area`, `land_use_zone`, `building_height_control`.

`check_db.py` proves the read-only role in two layers:

1. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, DROP, ALTER, CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX
   each fail with SQLSTATE 25006, the read-only transaction default.
2. With `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION READ WRITE` the same writes
   fail with SQLSTATE 42501, so the GRANT layer is proven independently of the
   session default.

It also proves the timeout (`pg_sleep(6)` cancelled at 5.0 s with 57014), asserts
that geography columns return metres (1107 m for 0.01 degrees of latitude) while
a `::geometry` cast returns 0.01 degrees, and warns that `neuro_ro` can disable
its own `statement_timeout` with `SET statement_timeout = 0` - no GRANT can stop
that, so the real wall-clock guarantee has to come from the Day 10 process
supervisor, not from Postgres.

## Conventions

- The agent only ever connects with the read-only `neuro_ro` role. Ingestion
  and `truth_sql` use `DB_URL_ADMIN`.
- The LLM writes Python; the numbers come from the runtime. No arithmetic in
  the model's head.
- `YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD` includes both dates in full (end is exclusive at
  the next midnight).
- Distances are in metres because location columns are `geography`; casting to
  `::geometry` silently switches to degrees.
- The Day 4 schema prompt must only describe tables that actually hold rows.
  A query against an empty table returns a silent `0`, which is worse than an
  error; `eia_*`, `traffic_camera`, `land_use_zone` and `building_height_control`
  stay out until Day 2 populates them.

## Troubleshooting

- `docker: command not found` in a terminal that was already open before the
  install: close and reopen it. The installer appends
  `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin` to the user `PATH`.
- `error getting credentials ... docker-credential-desktop` means the same
  stale-`PATH` problem.
- Ollama answers on `:11434` only after the desktop app (or `ollama serve`) is
  running; start it once per reboot if it is not set to launch at login.
